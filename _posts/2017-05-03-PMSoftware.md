￼A good project manager plans in order to understand the work to be accomplished.   

### Collaboration 

The choice of your project management and collaboration software is not an easy one.  There are many decision factors such
as the budget, the size of the team and the project, and the management reporting needs.  You also want to ensure that
the tool integrates well with your other systems.
