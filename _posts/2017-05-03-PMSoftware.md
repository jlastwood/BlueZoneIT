￼A good project manager plans in order to understand the work to be accomplished.   

### Collaboration and Communication

The choice of your project management and collaboration software is not an easy one.  There are many decision factors such
as the budget, the size of the team and the project, and the management reporting needs.  You also want to ensure that
the tool integrates well with your other systems.  

Here are some of the popular choices.

### Estimation, Resource and Costs

You will need at some point to estimate the project effort, resources and time.   In an agile, iterative and incremental model you are doing this often.  However, don't have the team estimating all the time.   I prefer estimation based on past performance but when you are working with a new team, that is not possible.
