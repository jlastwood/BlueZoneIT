The initiation and planning phases
of the project begin as soon as you hire your project manager.   This includes establishing what is going to get done, what is the budget, getting the team and 
vendors onboard and establishing the objectives and key deliverables.  He will also setup the communication and Project Management communication and collaboration tools.  

The Project Manager will send a questionnaire to the client, plus have 1 or 2 meetings to gather information about the project.    In 5-7 business days, the Project Manager will have the project initiated and once you approve, we are ready to start work.

### The client needs to provide

* Provide names of any team members that you want us to use
* Brand book, your ideas for logos, fonts, colors for your site or marketing
* Any designs, ideas or graphics you have in mind
* Inspiration sites.  Have you seen this done somewhere else.  What do you like or not like about their ideas.

### The PM will deliver 

* Charter
  * Scope of the project:  What is to be done?
  * Resource plan:  Who are the team members or if staffing needs to be done
  * Communication plan:   How will team members communicate, how often, how often will project status reports be deliverd to the client.
  * Constraints, Assumptions and Risks:  What is the budget, are there important time constraints or regulatory requirements
* Business Case (optional)
* Financial Plan:  Overview of budget and planned costs

### The Communication Board

We have a sample Trello board or excel sheet template to setup your project.   
  
We are ready to start the project.  Watch out now, things will happen fast now that planning is complete and the 
project manager is communicating, monitoring and mentoring the teams.
