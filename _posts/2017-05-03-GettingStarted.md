￼The following article covers what will happen once you onboard the Project Manager.  This is the initiation and planning phases
of the project.  This includes establishing what is going to get done, what is the budget,getting the team and 
vendors onboard and establishing they key deliverables.   We will also setup the communication and Project Management tools 
at this time.  

The Project Manager will send a questionnaire to the client, plus have 1 or 2 meetings to gather information about the project
from the client.    In 5-7 business days, the Project Manager will have the project initiated and we are ready to start work.

### What the client needs to provide

* Provide names of any team members that you want us to use
* Brand book, your ideas for logos, fonts, colors for your site or marketing
* Any designs, ideas or graphics you have in mind
* Inspiration sites.  Have you seen this done somewhere else.  What do you like or not like about their ideas.

### What the PM will deliver in the first week

* Charter
 * Scope of the project:  What is to be done?
 * Resource plan:  Who are the team members or if staffing needs to be done
 * Communication plan:   How will team members communicate, how often, how often will project status reports be deliverd to the client.
 * Constraints, Assumptions and Risks:  What is the budget, are there important time constraints or regulatory requirements
* Business Case (optional)
 
We are now ready to start the project.  Watch out now, things should happen fast if the planning and the team are communicating
effectively to the goal line.
