￼A good project manager develops and utilizes repeatable templates that are specific to the industry they're dealing with. This allows project plans to become very thorough and highly repeatable, with the specific intent to increase quality, lower delivery costs, and lower time to deliver.

Agile means iterative and incremental development.  We prefer an hybrid/agile model focused on solution delivery or disciplined agile delivery that takes into account the entire process or life cycle including development, testing and release/deployment to the operations team.
