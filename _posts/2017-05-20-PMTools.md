￼A good project manager develops and utilizes repeatable templates that are specific to the industry they're dealing with. This allows project plans to become very thorough and highly repeatable, with the specific intent to increase quality, lower delivery costs, and lower time to deliver.

The iterative and incremental development models.  I do subscribe to both the iterative and incremental development model which includes Agile methodologies.   I use Kanban model more often than Scrum in teams that are globally disbursed and we generally have weekly standup meetings via conference call.

### Estimation, Resource and Costs

You will need at some point to estimate the project effort, resources and time.   In an agile, iterative and incremental model you are doing this often.  You however don't want to have your team estimating all the time.  

### Communicaition

Slack or alternate, although at this time Slack is my favourite at this time.  We also use Skype frequently.   Mattermost is a private cloud slack alternative if you need more security but I have not tried this.
